**Background**

Government agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control can use social media information to get an understanding of the spread of infectious disease. By analyzing the use of words and expressions that appear over time on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, etc., it is possible to
estimate where the disease is affecting people and whether it is spreading or appears to be contained.

In this project, I design and develop an application that analyzes a small set of Twitter data to look for tweets regarding occurrences of the flu and determines the US states in which these tweets occur.
